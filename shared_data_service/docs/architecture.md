# Architecture Notes

## Layering and flows

```
HTTP request ──► api/router (thin) ──► business service ──► repository ──► PostgreSQL
                                          │
                                          └─ UnitOfWork: stage events → commit → publish

RabbitMQ ──► messaging/consumer ──► registry ──► module event handler
             (decode CloudEvent)                      │
                                                      ▼
                                              business service (same one)
                                              inbox dedup + version guard
                                              commit — nothing republished
```

Dependencies point downward only. The business layer imports neither FastAPI
nor RabbitMQ; the API and consumer edges import the business layer, never
repositories.

Supervision: the container owns the consumer task — ANY uncancelled
completion (crash or clean return) is logged CRITICAL and flips `/ready`'s
`consumer` check to false (a dead consumer can never look healthy). Each
queue is retried independently on failure, so one bad queue neither kills
nor hides the others. RabbitClient's consume() runs a watchdog that turns a
broker-side Basic.Cancel (queue deleted) into a raise — aio-pika swallows it
silently and only restores consumers on reconnect, so without the watchdog a
deleted queue is an invisible outage. Broker readiness uses the connection's
live `connected` event, not `is_closed` (which stays false during a
reconnect loop). Settings refuse consuming modes with an empty queue list,
and the container is restart-safe: `start()` after `stop()` rebuilds the
consumer graph (a closed batcher would otherwise nack everything forever
while looking healthy).

## Two object graphs, one codebase

The composition root (`app/bootstrap/container.py`) wires the same
`UserService` twice:

| graph    | UnitOfWork publisher   | effect                                |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| API      | `QueueEventPublisher`  | events published after commit         |
| consumer | `NullEventPublisher`   | consumer can never republish, by construction |

## Transactions

One `UnitOfWork` per API request / consumed message. Repositories join the
UoW's session and never commit. Domain events are staged during the
transaction; `commit()` publishes them strictly afterwards, `rollback()`
discards them. Read paths also commit (releases locks, keeps ORM instances
usable after the session closes).

**Commit-succeeds-publish-fails** is logged loudly with the event payload and
correlation id and does not fail the request — this is the documented gap the
Outbox closes: implement an `OutboxPublisher` that inserts staged events into
an `outbox` table on the same session, plus a relay process; only bootstrap
changes. Cancellation (client disconnect, shutdown) mid-publish is logged
CRITICAL with the ids of every not-yet-published staged event, then
re-raised — the commit stands, and the loss is never silent. Note the
recovery asymmetry until the Outbox lands: a replayed CREATE re-announces
the stored state event, but a lost `user.updated` publish has no re-announce
path (a later update supersedes it with newer full state).

## Idempotency & ordering

- **Inbox** (`processed_events`, PK = source + event id): inserted in the
  same transaction as the entity write; duplicate deliveries hit the PK and
  are skipped. Works across any number of instances.
- **Versioned state events**: `user.created` / `user.updated` carry the full
  entity state and its `version`. The consumer upserts when the row is
  missing (update-before-create), applies when `event.version > stored`,
  drops as stale otherwise (late create after update).
- **API**: create is an idempotent insert keyed on the client-supplied id
  (replay → 200, contradictory replay — name, email OR attributes — → 409);
  updates take a row lock and honor optional `expected_version` (409 on
  mismatch). A replayed create RE-ANNOUNCES the stored state event: if the
  first attempt died in the ambiguous commit window (commit applied, ack
  lost, event dropped — logged CRITICAL by the UoW), the retry publishes it;
  consumers drop the duplicate via the version guard.

## Consumer micro-batching (throughput without losing guarantees)

One PostgreSQL commit per consumed message caps throughput at the database's
fsync rate. The consumer therefore funnels concurrent deliveries through a
**greedy batcher** (`messaging/batcher.py`) into one business call —
`apply_state_events(batch)` — which runs ONE transaction: bulk inbox insert
(duplicates filtered by RETURNING), highest-version-per-user wins within the
batch, and a single atomic `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE .. WHERE
stored.version < new.version` (no row locks; the version guard is evaluated
by PostgreSQL).

Reliability is unchanged:

- The batcher is greedy — it never waits to fill a batch. Idle traffic gets
  batches of one (zero added latency); batches only grow when a backlog
  exists because deliveries queue while the previous commit is in flight.
- `submit()` resolves only after the batch's COMMIT, so RabbitClient acks
  each message strictly after its data is durable — at-least-once, same as
  unbatched.
- A failed batch is retried item-by-item: a poison item fails alone (its
  message requeues); the rest are applied and acked.
- Crash mid-batch: nothing committed → all messages redeliver → the inbox
  and version guard make the replay a no-op beyond the original effect.
- Shutdown never hangs or drops: a closed batcher fails queued AND in-flight
  submits with `BatcherClosedError` (a plain Exception → RabbitClient nacks
  while the channel is still open) and a late submit cannot resurrect it.
- Each flush runs under its own correlation id (a batch merges many message
  contexts); per-event ids are logged at DEBUG.

## Poison-message defense in depth

Anything that can never succeed must be acked away, not requeued. The
permanent/transient classification lives in EventConsumer's DISPATCH — not
in module handlers — so every module, current and future, is poison-safe by
construction (handlers just validate and write; dispatch decides ack vs
requeue):

1. Envelope: CloudEvents id/source/type are bounded to 255 chars (the inbox
   column width) and NUL-free (they land verbatim in `processed_events`
   text columns) — violations are an invalid envelope.
2. Payload: `UserEventData` enforces storability (no NUL bytes, no
   NaN/Infinity — PostgreSQL rejects both at execute time) plus a minimal
   shape floor, all via `modules/shared/validation.py`. Email is a
   DELIBERATE asymmetry: the API ingress is strict (`valid_email` — exactly
   pydantic's EmailStr rule, so the schema and business floor cannot
   disagree) while the consumer path is permissive and stores the
   producer's value VERBATIM (`email_floor`). Events are full-state
   announcements; rejecting one over email syntax would freeze the replica
   at the previous version forever (rejected payloads are acked away), so
   only genuinely unstorable data is rejected there.
3. Last resort: a storage rejection that slipped past validation is
   classified by SQLSTATE, not exception class — `is_permanent_data_error`
   (`app/database/errors.py`) walks the driver exception chain for class-22
   codes. This matters: the asyncpg dialect raises generic `DBAPIError`,
   never `sqlalchemy.exc.DataError`, so a class-based catch silently never
   fires (an integration test pins the real driver behavior). Transient
   errors (connection loss, serialization) still raise → requeue → retry.

Rejection logs never contain PAYLOAD values — pydantic reasons go through
`validation_error_reason` (locations + messages only) and the specversion
check is a Literal field so it takes the same path. Envelope identifiers
(event id, type) ARE logged: they are operational metadata an operator needs
to act on a rejection.

## RabbitClient semantics the consumer relies on

`rabbit_client.RabbitClient` (the `rabbit-client` package from
`../rabbit-client-python`, a uv path dependency): handler **return = ack**, handler
**raise = nack + requeue**. Therefore permanent failures (invalid envelope,
unknown type, invalid payload, stale version, duplicate) LOG AND RETURN so the
message is acked away — never poison-looped; only transient failures
(database down) raise and get redelivered.

## Adding an entity

Create `app/modules/<entity>/` with `model.py`, `repository.py`,
`business.py`, `schemas.py`, `events.py`, `router.py`; register the router
and event handlers in bootstrap; add an Alembic revision. Nothing outside
the module and bootstrap changes.
